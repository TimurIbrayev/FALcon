# Exploring Foveation and Saccade for Improved Weakly-Supervised Localization
**FALcon** is an active object localization framework incorporating the bio-plausible mechanisms of foveation and saccades for improved and resilient weakly supervised object localization.

The work was presented at _NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Gaze Meets ML (GMML)_ and published at _Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)_. The manuscript can be found at [this link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v226/ibrayev24a/ibrayev24a.pdf).
