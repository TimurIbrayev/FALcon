# Exploring Foveation and Saccade for Improved Weakly-Supervised Localization
**FALcon** is an active object localization framework incorporating the bio-plausible mechanisms of foveation and saccades for improved and resilient weakly supervised object localization.

The work was presented at _NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Gaze Meets ML (GMML)_ and published at _Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)_. The manuscript can be found at [this link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v226/ibrayev24a/ibrayev24a.pdf).

This is the official repository providing the code, model weights, and data to enable reproducibility of the work.

## Usage

▶ The framework is implemented as a set of separate script for each individual operation, e.g. ```FALcon_train_cub``` for training FALcon on CUB-200-2011 dataset samples.

▶ The operations of different scripts are controlled by one of the configuration scripts, e.g. ```FALcon_config_cub``` for the operations on CUB-200-2011 dataset samples.

▶Please, address the dropdown below for the short description of scripts and directories in the repository.
  <details>
  <summary>Descriptions of scripts</summary>
  
  | Script name | Script role |
  |-------------|-------------|
  |```FALcon_train_{dataset}```| Trains FALcon on the corresponding dataset. |
  |```FALcon_config_*```| Specifies different operational parameters for the execution of scripts. |
  |```FALcon_test_as_WSOL```| Tests FALcon on the dataset specified in ```FALcon_config_test_as_WSOL```.  |
  |```FALcon_models```| Contains class of VGG-like models for the implementation of FALcon. |
  |```FALcon_collect_{dataset}```| Runs FALcon on the samples of the corresponding dataset. Used to partition "long runs" of data collection. |
  |```AVS_functions```| Contains functions specific to the framework. |
  |```cls_models```| Contains various models used for the classification by FALcon and/or PSOL. |
  |```psol_*```| Performs the similar operations as the corresponding FALcon scripts, but using only PSOL framework. |
  |```utils/```| Contains a set of helper functions, not necessarily specific to the proposed framework. |
  |```PSOL/```| Contains a copy of PSOL github code, which incorporates our re-implemented scripts for training models on CUB-200-2011 dataset. |
